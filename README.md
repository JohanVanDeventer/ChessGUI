# ChessGUI
This is a simple homemade chess GUI using Python and PyGame.

The GUI allows different chess engines to be matched against each other in a series of games to determine the stronger engine.

The GUI uses UCI to communicate with engines.

Copy the engine executables in the "engine_1" and "engine_2" folders and adjust the path name in main.py to set up the program.

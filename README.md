# ChessGUI
This is a simple homemade chess GUI using Python and PyGame.

The GUI allows different chess engines to be matched against each other in a series of games to determine the stronger engine. It is made for InvinciBot (https://github.com/JohanVanDeventer/InvinciBot), however it can work for other chess engines with little to no modification because the GUI uses UCI to communicate with engines, which is standard in most chess engines.

Copy the engine executables in the "engine_1" and "engine_2" folders and adjust the path name in "main.py" to set up the program.
